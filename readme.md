# dotfiles
my dotfiles for all my programs  

## requirements
you need gnu stow to set up the dots, although technically this could be done manually i do not recommend that.  
  
the status bar has a spotify module, which obviously requires spotify, aswell as playerctl.  
if you don't have any of these, it will be fine, but it will not work.
